# PIC18-Sudoku-Project

Sudoku game prototype made for the PIC18F87K22 microcontroller mounted on the EasyPIC PRO™ v7 development board. To be used with: the 128x64 pixel Winstar Display Co. WDG 0151 GLCD screen, mounted to the development board using PORTB pins B0:B5 as a control bus and PORTD as a one byte data bus; and a 4×4 membrane keypad connect to PORTE.

This project is written in assembler code and is given in an MPLAB project file, to be compiled in MPLAB v5.05 and transmitted to the PIC18 via MPLAB ICD 3 in-circuit debugger.

This project was made by Dakshesh Kololgi and Jacob Davies as part of the Imperial College physics third year microprocessor lab course in February 2020.
